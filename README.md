Window blind automation over wifi TCP/IP

I made this project some years ago to automate my home window blinds. The idea was to use the blinds as an alarm clock and awake by the morning sun light, but the reality is I wake up because the motor noise and on winter it is still dark :(

I would like to share the code because the system works fine and is very practical. I'm amazed how reliable are the aliexpress components. This setup has been running for the last two years without issues.
